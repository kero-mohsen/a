11-difference between (wav, Mp3)?
Wav:- it's stands for wavform audio file format, and the audio file is uncompressed,
the Sound quality of the original audio signals is retained, and It used only in
high-quality CDs, professional recording.
Mp3:- it's stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer-3,and it's file largely compressed so the
Sound quality is heavily decreased, and Mp3 the most common audio format, used
for storing and transferring songs.
WMA file extension:- is short for Windows Media Audio, which is an audio file
container and serves as an audio codec too. The regular WMA format
contains lossy audio data “WMA Lossless” is available too. Widely used for
voice content and audio recordings, WMA offers great compatibility with all
major multimedia players and editing software.
12-difference between(coco, yolo, pascal) ?
Coco:- coco is a huge image dataset collected for object detection, segmentation,
person key points detection, object segmentation, and caption generation, and the
annotations are stored using json file. coco x,y top left, w, h.
Method of recording the boundaries of object: polygon-based, speed: slow
Yolo:- yolo is an abbreviation that stands for you only look once and It useing txt file.
yolo x.y center, w, h.
Method of recording the boundaries of object:
Grid-based, speed: very fast
Pascal:- pascal is a data annotation format that stores annotation information in xml
format.
pascal: x,y min top left, x.y max bottom right, Method of recording the boundaries of
object:
Rectangle-based, speed: fast.
13-difference between text extensions?
1. **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**
- A text format for organizing data in a table structure.
- Data is separated by commas or specified delimiters (typically comma or
semicolon).
- Widely used for data interchange between applications and data analysis.
2. **XLSX (Excel Spreadsheet):**
- A file format for spreadsheets used in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel.
- Organizes cells in rows and columns, supporting text, numbers, images, and
charts.
3. **TXT (Plain Text):**
- A simple text format containing plain text without formatting.
- Used for basic data storage, human-readable, and machine-readable.
4. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**
- A markup language used to build web pages.
- Contains encoding elements defining structure, content, and linking between
pages.
5. **PDF (Portable Document Format):**
- A file format containing text, images, and graphics independently of software and
hardware.
- Used for document exchange across different systems without losing formatting.
6.JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation) : the data is complex, nested, and
object-oriented, and you are working with web applications and APIs.
7. XML (Extensible Markup Language) : should be chosen if the data is rich,
hierarchical, and document-based, and you are working with XML standards and
formats.
